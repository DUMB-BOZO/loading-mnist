# MNIST Digit Classifier with TensorFlow Keras

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating a simple yet effective Neural Network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project aims to build, train, and evaluate a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow Keras.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to implement a basic neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the widely-used MNIST dataset. The network architecture is designed to flatten the input images and then process them through dense layers with ReLU activation, culminating in a Softmax output layer for multi-class classification. The model's performance is evaluated using a comprehensive classification report.



## Model Architecture

The neural network is a sequential model composed of the following layers:
